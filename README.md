# Unified Battery Management Code for AGM and Lithium Batteries

## Overview

This code is a versatile and adaptive solution that allows you to incorporate both AGM (Absorbent Glass Mat) and lithium batteries into the same circuit without risk of damaging either type. It's particularly useful for projects where you need the flexibility to use different battery chemistries for various applications.

## Key Features


1. **Adaptive Charging and Discharging:**
   - It dynamically adjusts the charging and discharging parameters based on the detected battery type, ensuring that each battery is handled optimally for its specific requirements.

2. **Voltage Monitoring:**
   - The code continuously monitors the voltage, allowing you to keep track of their performance in real-time.

3. **Balanced Power Distribution:**
   - It intelligently allocates power from the batteries, ensuring they work together harmoniously without overloading or underutilizing either source.

4. **Prevention of Overcharging and Over-Discharging:**
   - The code safeguards the batteries by preventing overcharging and over-discharging, which can extend their lifespan and maintain their health.

5. **User-Friendly Integration:**
   - It's designed to be easily integrated into your existing circuits, Arduino projects, or other microcontroller-based applications. The code is well-documented with clear instructions for setup and configuration.

## Getting Started

1. **Components Needed:**
   - Arduino or compatible microcontroller
   - AGM battery
   - Lithium battery
   - Appropriate resistors (as per circuit design)

2. **Upload the Code:**
   - Upload the provided code to your microcontroller using your preferred development environment (e.g., Arduino IDE).

3. **Power On:**
   - Power on the microcontroller and connect both the AGM and lithium batteries.
